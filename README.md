> Some reasons why I do not have it
  ## Privacy
  Can you imagine a group of people which knew about you everythin'  <br>
  and, at the same time, you knew about them nothing? I certainly can't. <br>
  Now, let's be honest: the fight is lost; Look at the Sim, Operating System, GPS and more.. <br>
  Your data isn't belongs to you anymore. It's completely shared with goverment. <br>
  You can't really know which things they know and which do not know, <br>
  You can't even expect what they can predict; It's all aginst criminals!
  
> “Isn't it pretty to think so.”
― Ernest Hemingway

 ##  Life
   Without a close contact of society, you rely more on yourself than on someone else. <br>
   You can solve the problems in your own way, life become a little intresting. <br>
   And you got no stress, no ads, notifications and no .. propaganda. <br>
   
> “Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born.”
       ― Nikola Tesla
   
  ## Liberty
   You may don't have a phone simply because you have a freedom to. <br>
   The world is greater than a set of mainstreems. It only begins where you think it ends. <br>
   You have a freedom of choise along with the other freedoms like communication and vote. <br>
   If you are not able to use your freedoms learn how. If it's impossible then fight for. <br>

# Stop 2FA

> Avoid any site which recommends verification via phone, because

## It does not:
* Protect your privacy
* Respect your freedom

## It actually does:
* Nullifies VPN
* Helps censorship
* Helps goverment surveillance
* Increases risk to loose authentification key

## Does it helps business?
In a nutshell, yes. It provides better abbility to track, register and censor. <br>
This is how bussines works. That's why Microsoft and Google are very powerful. <br>
> Linux is lovely one, however BIOS provided by the manufacturers

## Alternative way for privacy purpose?
256 bit crypto key is impossible to crack. Why? <br>
```python
2^256 ~ 1.158 * 10^77 # the number of possible keys
# Only 10 times less than a number of photons in the universe!
# (Estimated 4×10^84) See
# https://www.astronomy.com/science/how-many-photons-has-the-universe-produced-in-its-life
```
It's obviously much easier to loose the key, than got hacked. <br>
Thanks mobile phone which you take everywhere. You might think, additional checks <br>
will grant the more safety, but I think not. The more data you share, the more likely you loose it.

## Bot accounts
Someone might say verification is against bot accounts. <br>
Well, there is another solution: Capcha! <br> 
Multiple accounts will be allowed, but .. is it a big problem? <br>
Anyway no more problem than keepin' data centers!

# Free web 4

> Some views for the internet freedom <br>
> A website shall be..

## A place of collaboration
Collaboration means discuss something, share something, promote something and so on. <br>
Web apps are not good, because can't be better than have installed the same application. <br>
Any AI shall also be open and shared, altough such machines is not easy to build at home. <br>
AI developed in scince purpuse and scince achievements belong to everyone.

## Fairly downloadable
Any hosted content shall might be downloaded without any confirms or payments. <br>
This includes open license, no obfuscation and no other problems to read the source code. <br>
If the website sells digital content, free will donations are ok. All because data can be reproduced unlimited times.

## Cookie-free
Website shall require as less conditions as possible. <br>
No required Cookies, Location, Notification and so on. <br>
This is because customer have a right to privacy along with right to use any service.

## Anonymous well
Non-existence of Authentication is priceless. The less data you share the more free can you feel. <br>
Only anonymously, the freedom of speech is complete. Therefore, Anonymous users shall be at least equal to registred.

 # Understand free software
  The concept of the [propritary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) 
  is central in free software movement and privacy protection. <br>
  "Owner" never publish source code, so nobody can check what program actually does. <br>
  It can be taken back from you, either contain a kind of [backdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)). <br>
  Otherside, free software is maintained by community. It may have a developer team, or may not have. <br>
  Cetralised and decentralised free software discussed in essay [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://monoskop.org/images/e/e0/Raymond_Eric_S_The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar_rev_ed.pdf) <br>
