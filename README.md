# Reasons to avoid phone
   
  ## Privacy
  All privacy issues with smartphone is impossible to fix. <br>
  Starting from Sim, ongoing with whole Operating System, <br>
  finishing with independent GPS module. <br>
  Data isn't belongs to you anymore. It's definetely shared with goverment. <br>
  You can't really know which things they know and which does not know, <br>
  You don't expect what they can predict (don't forget AI)
   
 ##  Life
   Without a close contact of society, you rely more on yourself than on someone else. <br>
   You can solve the problems in your own way, you can say that is intresting. <br>
   Plus, no stress, no ads, notifications and no .. propaganda. <br>
   
> “Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born.”
       ― Nikola Tesla
   
  ## Liberty
   You may don't have a phone simply because you have a freedom to. <br>
   If everyone makes lobothomy, you aren't forced to do so. <br>
   You have a freedom of choise along with the other freedoms like transportation, vote and communication. <br>
   If you are not able to use your freedoms learn how. If it's not possible to use your freedoms fight for. <br>

      ― Immanuel Kant

# Stop 2FA

## It does not do:
* Protect your privacy
* Respect your freedom

## It actually does:
* Helps goverment surveillance
* Increases risk to loose authentification key
* Increases risk to loose personal data
* Helps censorship
* Nullifies VPN

## Does it helps business?
In a nutshell, yes. It provides better abbility to track, register and censor.

## Alternative way for privacy purpose?
Cryptography itself grants safety. 256 bit key almost impossible to crack. <br>
Much easier to loose the key thanks to mobile phone. You might think, additional checks <br>
grant the more safety, but this is not true. The more data you share, the more likely you loose it.

## Bot accounts
Capcha! Multiple accounts will be allowed, but .. is this a real problem? <br>
No more problem than keepin' giant data centers!

# Free web four rules

> A website shall be..

## A place of collaboration
Collaboration means discuss something, share something, promote something and so on. <br>
Web apps are not such good, because it can't be better than the normally installed programs. <br>
Any AI shall also be open and shared, altough such machines is not easy to build at home. <br>
AI developed in scince purpuse and scince achievements belong to everyone.

## Fairly downloadable
Any hosted content shall might be downloaded without any confirms or payments. <br>
This includes open license, no obfuscation and no other problems to read the source code. <br>
If the site sells digital content, free will donations are ok, because data can be cloned unlimited times.

## Cookie-free
Website shall require as less conditions as possible. <br>
No required Cookies, Location, Notification and so on. <br>
This is because customer have a right to privacy along with a right to use any service.

## Anonymous well
Non-existence of Authentication is priceless. The less data you share the more free you feel. <br>
Only anonymously freedom of speech is complete. Thus, Anonymous users shall be at least equal to registred.

 # Understand free software
  The concept of the [propritary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) 
  is central in free software movement and privacy protection. <br>
  ## Core thesis:
  Closed source is often [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)
  #
  Nobody can check what program actually do, unless it's source published. <br>
  Such a kind of programs maintained by a commercial company, generally should be avoided. <br>
  Otherside, free software is maintained by community. It may have a developer team, or may not have. <br>
  Cetralised and decentralised free software discussed in essay [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://monoskop.org/images/e/e0/Raymond_Eric_S_The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar_rev_ed.pdf) <br>
