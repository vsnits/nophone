# About a phone
> Why do not have it at all
  ## Privacy
  All privacy issues with smartphone is impossible to fix. <br>
  Starting from Sim, ongoing with whole Operating System, <br>
  finishing with independent GPS module. <br>
  Data isn't belongs to you anymore. It's definetely shared with goverment. <br>
  You can't really know which things they know and which does not know, <br>
  You don't expect what they can predict (don't forget AI)

 ##  Life
   Without a close contact of society, you rely more on yourself than on someone else. <br>
   You can solve the problems in your own way, you can say that is intresting. <br>
   Plus, no stress, no ads, notifications and no .. propaganda. <br>

  ## Liberty
   You may don't have a phone simply because you have a freedom to. <br>
   If everyone makes lobothomy, you aren't forced to do so. <br>
   You have a freedom of choise along with the other freedoms like transportation, vote and communication. <br>
   If you are not able to use your freedoms learn how. If it's impossible then fight for. <br>

## It does not:
* Protect your privacy
* Respect your freedom

## It actually does:
* Nullifies VPN
* Helps censorship
* Helps goverment surveillance
* Increases risk to loose authentification key

## Does it helps business?
In a nutshell, yes. It provides better abbility to track, register and censor. <br>
This is how bussines works. That's why Microsoft and Google are so much powerful. <br>
> Linux is great, however BIOS is still firmware

## Alternative way for privacy purpose?
256 bit crypto key is impossible to crack. Why? <br>
```python
2^256 ~ 1.158 * 10^77 # the number of possible keys
# Only 10 times less than a number of photons in the universe!
# (Estimated 4×10^84) See
# https://www.astronomy.com/science/how-many-photons-has-the-universe-produced-in-its-life
```
It's obviously much easier to loose the key, than got hacked <br>
Thanks mobile which you just take everywhere. You might think, additional checks <br>
will grant the more safety, but I think not. The more data you share, the more likely you loose it.

## Bot accounts
Someone might say verification is against bot accounts. <br>
Well, there is another solution: Capcha! <br> 
Multiple accounts will be allowed, but .. is it a real problem? <br>
Anyway, no more problem than keepin' giant data centers!

# Free web 4

> Some views for the internet freedom <br>
> A website shall be..

## A place of collaboration
Collaboration means discuss something, share something, promote something and so on. <br>
Web apps are not such good, because it can't be better than the normally installed programs. <br>
Any AI shall also be open and shared, altough such machines is not easy to build at home. <br>
AI developed in scince purpuse and scince achievements belong to everyone.

## Fairly downloadable
Any hosted content shall might be downloaded without any confirms or payments. <br>
This includes open license, no obfuscation and no other problems to read the source code. <br>
If the site sells digital content, free will donations are ok. All because data can be reproduced unlimited times.

## Cookie-free
Website shall require as less conditions as possible. <br>
No required Cookies, Location, Notification and so on. <br>
This is because customer have a right to privacy along with right to use any service.

## Anonymous well
Non-existence of Authentication is priceless. The less data you share the more free you feel. <br>
Only anonymously, the freedom of speech is complete. Thus, Anonymous users shall be at least equal to registred.

 # Understand free software
  The concept of the [propritary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) 
  is central in free software movement and privacy protection. <br>
  ## Core thesis:
  Closed source (proprietary) is often [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)
  #
  Nobody can check what program actually does, unless the source is published. <br>
  A kind of programs maintained by a commercial company, generally should be avoided. <br>
  Otherside, free software is maintained by community. It may have a developer team, or may not have. <br>
  Cetralised and decentralised free software discussed in essay [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://monoskop.org/images/e/e0/Raymond_Eric_S_The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar_rev_ed.pdf) <br>
