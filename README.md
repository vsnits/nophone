# Reasons to have no phone
   
  ## Privacy
  All privacy issues with smartphone is impossible to fix. <br>
  Starting from Sim, ongoing with whole Operating System, <br>
  finishing with independent GPS module. <br>
  Data isn't belongs to you anymore. It's definetely shared with goverment. <br>
  You can't really know which things they know and which does not know, <br>
  You don't expect what they can predict (don't forget AI)
   
 ##  Life
   Without a close contact with society you rely more on yourself that on someone else. <br>
   You can solve the problems in another way, you can say that is intresting. <br>
  Plus, no stress, no ads, notifications and no .. propaganda. <br>

  ## Liberty
   You may don't have a phone simply because you have a freedom to. <br>
   If everyone makes lobothomy, you aren't forced to do so. <br>
   You have a freedom of choise along with the other freedoms like transportation, vote and communication. <br>
   If you are not able to use your freedoms learn how. If it's not possible to use your freedoms fight for. <br>
