# Reasons to avoid phone
   
  ## Privacy
  All privacy issues with smartphone is impossible to fix. <br>
  Starting from Sim, ongoing with whole Operating System, <br>
  finishing with independent GPS module. <br>
  Data isn't belongs to you anymore. It's definetely shared with goverment. <br>
  You can't really know which things they know and which does not know, <br>
  You don't expect what they can predict (don't forget AI)
   
 ##  Life
   Without a close contact of society, you rely more on yourself than on someone else. <br>
   You can solve the problems in your own way, you can say that is intresting. <br>
   Plus, no stress, no ads, notifications and no .. propaganda. <br>
   
> “Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born.”
       ― Nikola Tesla
   
  ## Liberty
   You may don't have a phone simply because you have a freedom to. <br>
   If everyone makes lobothomy, you aren't forced to do so. <br>
   You have a freedom of choise along with the other freedoms like transportation, vote and communication. <br>
   If you are not able to use your freedoms learn how. If it's not possible to use your freedoms fight for. <br>

      ― Immanuel Kant

# Stop 2FA
I strongly recommend to `aviod` double factor verification via `phone`. <br>
## What it does not do:
* Protect your privacy
* Respect your freedom
## What it actually does:
* Helps goverment surveillance
* Increases risk to lost authentification key
* Increases risk to loose personal data
* Helps censorship
## Does it helps business?
In a nutshell, yes. It provides better abbility to track, register and censor.
## Alternative ways for privacy purpose?
Cryptography itself grants safety. 256 bit key almost impossible to crack. <br>
Much easier to loose key thanks to mobile phone. You might think, additional checks <br>
grant more safety, but this is not true. The more data you share, the more likely you loose it.
## Bot accounts  
Capcha! Multiple accounts will be allowed, but .. is this a real problem? <br>
No more problem than keepin' giant data centers!
